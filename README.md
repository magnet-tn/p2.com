# Project 2 - XKCD Style Password Generator for CSCI-E15 (DWA)

## Live URL
<http://p2.troubleU.com>

## Description
This repository holds a password generator application in the style of the XKCD pw generator.

The application will produce a password string based upon words from a story I wrote. The application accepts the following user input to randomly generate a delimited password:

- number of unique words in password.
- selection for adding a random integer
- selection for adding a random special characters
- selection for one of three methods of delimiting the words (hyphen, space, or camel case.)

I hope you enjoy the application.

## Details for teaching team
No login required.

Note on the insertion of a number or special character:
If the user chooses to include a random integer or special character, the application will select a random position at the front or back of a word, so that no word is interrupted by a digit or character. This is to facilitate the memorization of the word string.
