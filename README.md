# Project 2 - XKCD Style Password Generator for CSCI-E15 (DWA)

## Live URL
<http://p2.troubleU.com>

## Description
This repository holds a password generator application in the style of the XKCD pw generator.

The application will produce a password string based upon words from a story I wrote. The application accepts the following user input to randomly generate a delimited password:

- number of unique words in password.
- selection for adding a random integer
- selection for adding a random special characters
- selection for one of three methods of delimiting the words (hyphen, space, or camel case.)

I hope you enjoy the application.

## Details for teaching team
No login required.

Note on the insertion of a number or special character:
If the user chooses to include a random integer or special character, the application will select a random position at the front or back of a word, so that no word is interrupted by a digit or character. This is to facilitate the memorization of the word string.

Final note about Live Server Problem:(sep 29)
I made some kind of error that blocks any changes I make to my files on the Production Server. So if you go to my repository called p2 (this one is p2.com) I have a complete copy of this same work. Those refer to a p2 directory on the production server (instead of the non-working p2.com). To distinguish the two I have added "Fall 2016" to the <h> tag at the top of the web page. Also, some notes in this <em>readme.md.</em>  Otherwise the two repositories are the same.
