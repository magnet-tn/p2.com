## Description
This repository holds a password generator application in the style of the XKCD pw generator.

The application will produce a password string based upon words from a story I wrote. The application accepts the following user input to randomly generate a delimited password:

- number of unique words in password.
- selection for adding a random integer
- selection for adding a random special characters
- selection for one of three methods of delimiting the wors (hyphen, space, or camel case.)

I hope you enjoy the application.
